<h1>The GigMaker – Final Project</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

TheGigMaker project aims to connect users together and collaborate on potential projects of interest. In other words, the GigMaker is a “gig bank” of sorts. Users find projects or create their own. For example, if someone wants to develop their web development skills you can create a gig focused on web development.  

<h3>Technical Details</h3>

The GigMaker is a web application following the MERN framework (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). 
New users can sign in with their google mail account and begin searching for projects to collaborate on (as a gigster) or create own your project (as a gigmaster) and find potential team mates. 
If users need help with anything project-related, please use the project description to find the contact information for the project lead gigmaster.
